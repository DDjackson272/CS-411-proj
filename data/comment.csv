2,9,Great place!,,
2,10,We stayed here four (Website hidden by Airbnb) was consistently top notch.,,
2,11,Overall I enjoyed my stay because the hosts are very kind and friendly and despite some small issues, the bedroom is cozy and comfortable: The gaps between jalousie windows in the bedroom are quite large. Wish there is a lock for the room. And the calling light made me dizzy.,
2,13,This is a WONDERFUL place...bed like a cloud...cleaner than clean...EVERYTHING YOU NEED and super hosts!
3,4,Very clean, quiet neighborhood.
3,5,Really good and cheap place.
3,6,Great location close to parks and restaurants. Tyler has everything you can need & his place is awesome value. Would stay here again.

3,2,The room is not clean,we did not enjoy the experience stay.
3,11,Excellent place! Exactly what was needed for my trip!

4,2,Very convenient to campus. Quiet and basic place to sleep. Dog is so friendly,,
4,3,"It was just an overnight stay for me. Silleny's apartment is just right for me: quiet, good location, comfortable sleeping, hot water shower, nothing fancy but good enough for the price. I arrived at midnight but Silleny was very accommodating. His dog is friendly.",,
4,10,"Decent place, super chill host, friendly dog",,
4,9,Convenient location and very accommodating. The check-in/check-out procedure was very easy.,,
4,15,"Silleny's place was a stop over for me on a cross country road trip. Silleny gave me a great recommendation for a craft brewery in town. With the brewery and dinner I was there less than 12 hours so I can't speak to the amenities. It was quiet, appropriately priced, checking in and out was hassle free, and the shower had plenty of hot water. Silver (his dog) was a sweetheart.",,
4,13,"Not that good, dirty room.No sunshine.",,

5,2,LOVED this beautiful house as a quiet retreat after an IL basketball game,,
5,3,"This place is an absolute A+! The room was cozy, comfortable, clean and quite! They added a few touches to really make us feel at home. The cats were so very sweet! If we were ever in the area again we would definitely stay!",,
5,11,"Lovely hosts, lovely accommodations. Consistently top rate.",,
5,15,This was our first time using an Airbnb host. I can not believe how smoothly planning and making the reservation went. Bobbie and Kevin are perfect hosts. Their accommodations are perfectly described and more wonderful than I expected. I would also like to compliment their quiet and well insulated rooms. We were never disturbed by any noise either inside or outside of the house such as hearing other guests and no traffic noises which in a hotel on the road can be quite annoying and disturbing. Unequivocally we would stay with Bobbie and Kevin again. We will be back.,,
5,13,Nice house good neighborhood very clean. Perfect for what my wife and I needed for an overnight stay and the price was very fair.,,
5,10,I stayed at Bobbie's place while apartment hunting. I appreciated the proximity to the U of I campus and Savoy shopping plaza. The room and amenities were clean and comfortable. Bobbie and Kevin are fantastic hosts with great tips for life in the area.,,
5,11,"Great home, quiet neighborhood, good hosts.",,
5,11,"We had a great stay at Silleny's place as a stopover during a long road trip. The house is located in a quiet residential area. The room was clean and spacious with an adjoining bathroom. The kitchen was also available to use, and Bobbie and Kevin thoughtfully provided teas, coffee, and snack items. They were pleasant, friendly, and accommodating during our short stay, and even allowed us to store our bikes in their garage to keep them out of the rain.",,
5,1,Extremely clean place in a quiet neighborhood. I highly recommend Bobbie¡¯s place and I am planning to come back.,,
5,6,This is my second stay at Bobbie¡¯s place. It is a very clean place in a convenient and quiet area. Bobbie and Kevin are great hosts. I highly recommend Bobbie¡¯s place and I will always look for it when visiting the Champaign area.,,
6,11,Morteza¡¯s place is centrally located for UIUC visits. I stayed one night and everything was as promised. Check in was easy and street parking was easy to find. Morteza was very accessible and responsive before and during my stay. Thanks for an enjoyable visit!,,
6,15,Posting is very accurate. Parking is on street and we had no problems finding a spot even on a busy weekend.,,
6,12,"I was on a cross-country road trip - Morteza was able to accommodate my last minute request. Easy easy self checkin. The space is clean and had everything I needed. Thanks, Morteza!",,
6,1,"Overall a good place. Just not meant for a lot of people.
Easy check-in. Place was sparkling clean. Room included a desk for work and a generously-sized closet.",,

6,13,"Good place to stay couple of nights, house was pretty clean with good amenities and also very close to UIUC.",,
7,2,"The place is nice, quiet and convenient to visit UIUC. The host is super organized and kindly responds immediately to messages. The place is clean and overall a great stay. Very recommended!",,
7,3,"This is a student housing apartment complex. We stayed in a display unit. Very quiet, extremely clean. The other two rooms were vacant so we had the whole place to ourselves. Didn't use the pool or hot tub but the patio-atrium area was nice, very clean. I'd stay here again.",,
7,4,"We stayed at the atrium for 2 days. If I got another chance to visit, I¡¯ll choose Ryan¡¯s place again! The rooms are clean and so is the restroom. The day we checked in, the other 3 rooms were not occupied, so it is very quiet at night. Anyway, it is a very satisfying stay!",,
7,1,"I do not like this place actually. No window, no sunshine.No fresh air.",,
7,6,"Cheap place, but I do not like to stay here. The building is stale.",,
7,5,Great set up that¡¯s easy to navigate and very close to campus. A bus route goes right there. The bed is not the best but overall it was a great experience,,
7,6,"For the price that you pay, this is the amazing option if you need to stay for a couple of nights in U-C. The room and the bathroom were super clean, the check-in was easy, and the host was very friendly. Will come back for sure!",,
7,15,"Nice, affordable, and clean place to stay when visiting U of I.",,
7,14,Very comfortable experience. Location is not good. Not convinent.,,
7,13,"We were a small youth group traveling with parents. We had a nice, easy stay. kids enjoyed pool and game room. We didnt spend much time in apartment but we did like bringing our own snacks and breakfast. reasonable price, and nice group settong as opposed to separate hotel rooms... we're looking to stay there next year for same event. extra towels available in room, easy check in and out.",,
7,12,I hate this place. Looks very stale and dirty. The air is not fresh.,,
8,10,"Thanks for a great stay on a busy UIUC Moms weekend. Comfortable, quiet house even with 5 or 6 other people staying there! J is great with communication and instructions; she really cares about her guests¡¯ overall comfort.",,
8,10,Place is nice & clean. I would recommend this place. You will not ne disappointed.,,
8,9,"It is too far away from UIUC. If you don't have a car, trust me, do not choose here.",,
8,7,"J is an excellent communicator and a very kind host. She offered so many extras and made me feel right at home. I don't always feel comfortable staying in someone else's house, but I did in J's. Would highly recommend.",,
8,10,Nice clean place with reasonable price,,
8,10,"It's my 4th time that I stay at J's house, and her home is excellent. It would be like your house during your stay there. Everything is clean and well-organized. J is a great host, and she is really helpful. If she wasn't able to do the check-in, she has nice friends that do it instead of her.",,
8,1,"I enjoyed my stay and would recommend without hesitation. Jes is a thoughtful, gracious hostess. Great value.",,
8,15,"Too far away from downtown. Near the avenue, too much noise.",,
8,11,"Such an affordable place to stay. House was very clean and quiet, which makes a temporary lodging so much more enjoyable.",,
8,13,"This room is clean, comfortable and has everything you need. The shower is great and the house is quiet. Jes provides wonderful options for breakfast. She also has a basket of various toiletries so you can purchase something if you forget it. Check-in and check-out were easy.",,
9,8,Lovely room in a beautiful house with fantastic hosts! Great conversations and adorable cats.,,
9,7,"Had a wonderful stay! The space is really serene, bed is very comfortable, great proximity to downtown and to campus. Lee communicated promptly, check-in and out was a breeze!",,

9,1,"No parking area. Generally, it is fair.",,
9,12,"Lee was prompt in communicating. Check in was easy. Bed was super comfortable. Location is great-- nice, quiet neighborhood.",,
9,15,No parking area which makes me mad. I like the host and his cat. The room is just fine but not that good for me.,,
9,14,A really warm and nice place to stay,,
9,3,"Besides the fact that I loved being greeted by two ADORABLE cats every time I walked in the door, this house is so aesthetically pleasing. Lee was so understanding when my original check in time got delayed, and check in itself was a breeze! The room was SO CUTE with loads of personal touches, plenty of outlets, a desk with a computer should you forget your own, and a super comfy bed. 10/10 would recommend :)",,
9,4,"Lee is a very nice host and the Lavanda room is quite pretty. The apartment is close to Dunkin Dounats and CVS Parmacy. Campustown and Champaign Downtown are in walking distance. Lee has two cats, which leave a lot of hair. So, you will find the hair everywhere, especially on dark clothes. I have to admit that the apartment was not as clean as I hoped, although the Lavanda room was clean. The bed was warm and cosy. Lee even provided two bottles of spring water. Overall, for the price, the apartment is okay. I have seen worst in Champaign! Stephanie",,
10,1,"Thanks for a great place to stay for my husband, my two kids and myself. We were in town to visit my oldest son who is attending UofI and the place was just what we needed. The location is perfect with plenty of restaurants nearby - we went to Maize and Sticky Rice and loved them both! Access to the unit was super easy with a touch pad for the outside door and a key lock-box for the interior door! Theplace is very cute and cozy with the right amenities. We struggled at first to figure out how to turn on the heat and the TVs, but figured them out pretty quickly. You will enjoy your stay here!",,
10,1,"We didn't spend much time in the apartment, but it was very clean and stylish and a great location for walking to bars and restaurants. We had a fun girls night out!
",,
10,11,"Having only used AirBnB twice now, Lois was by far the best host I have had thus far! Quick response time and eternally accommodating; I can't recommend a better host and place to stay!",,
10,11,Awesome unit in a great location! Very romantic for a couple.,,
10,9,A very convinent place to stay. There is a nice park near the apartment. I like to walk in the park.,,
10,9,Lovely place! Close to many restaurants and coffee shops. Slept great!,,
10,9,This was a great location in downtown with close parking. A beautiful quaint apartment! Lois responded to all my questions. Everything we needed was standard and readily available.,,
10,9,Great place to stay in Champaign! The location is amazing and you can walk to lots of different bars and restaurants in the downtown area. Check in was super easy and the space is so cool! I would definitely stay here again,,
10,5,Lois is a wonderful host. Her apartment is in the center of the bar and restaurant district. I could not have been more pleased with the accommodations!!,,
10,6,Very good experience. Easy check-in and check-out. Quick responses.,,
10,7,Great location. Downtown access is welcome. Lovely rooms and amenities.,,
10,13,"Wonderful location downtown, right next to all the restaurants. The apartment is redone but still has characteristics of its historical charm. Would stay again!",,
11,1,"Staying at Stretch¡¯s place was nothing short of delightful. Great accommodations, convenient location and he and his lovely family go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. It¡¯s not just a room; it¡¯s an experience! We definitely will stay with them again in the future!",,
11,4,Great hosts. Will have to deal with a dog if you have alergies.,,
11,5,Stretch and Noni were terrific hosts and their space was the best airbnb I have stayed in. Great bed. Quiet and private space with bathroom in the suite. Great flexibility and communication. They asked if there was anything else we needed and they truly meant it.,,
11,15,"Stretch and his family (including the delightful Mr. Chung) are warm and welcoming. The suite they offer is private and spacious in a quiet residential neighborhood with plenty of parking. It was far enough from campus to be out of the fray, but close enough to be convenient (with a car). I slept well, was able to work, and had everything I needed for a long weekend stay in C-U.",,
11,2,"A cozy stay with a gracious host. It was a quick stay for me, I was in and out spending most of my time with my student at U of I. But if I wanted to hang out, I would be as comfortable as hanging at my own home. Also loved the comfy, flannel sheets on the bed as the weather was cool.",,
11,13,"Excellent communication, comfortable space and bed, good neighborhood.",,
11,10,"During a hard time in our lives, staying here has been a breath of fresh air. Your welcoming demeanor and Noni¡¯s generous hosting has been delightful. We have loved staying here and getting to know your sweet family. If we¡¯re in the Champaign area again, we¡¯d love to come back.",,
11,2,"ou will have a warm welcome, a super comfortable room, and fantastic communication with your host. Stretch truly opens his home to his guests.",,
11,9,I have stayed with Stretch and his family several times and always feel very welcome and comfortable. They truly enjoy their guests. There house is clean and unique. I like to look at all their artwork and pictures. They are also very accommodating and good at communicating with guests. I definitely recommend their place.,,
11,7,"Stretch and family were traveling while we were in town, so we worked with a grad student staying in his home. We were asked to communicate outside of airbnb via email, which made me a little uncomfortable. Was relatively clean except for some hair in the shower and quite a few bugs. The dog was sweet but barked all morning the first night we were there which made it challenging to sleep in. Location was great since we were attending a wedding at the stadium.",,
11,6,I had a wonderful time! Puppy loved her stay as well and misses Mr. Chung. It was very comfortable and private; welcoming and warm. I really appreciated my morning coffee in the yard. It was an easy 5 min drive to my campus conference. Perhaps not important to others but being across church was a plus for me!,,
11,8,We stayed at Stretch's place during graduation weekend which turned out to be a great decision on our part. Stretch and Noni are warm and extremely hospitable hosts whose suite is peaceful and inviting. We would definitely stay here again!,,
12,3,"I highly recommend Faylene¡¯s place if you are visiting Urbana/Champaign. Her apartment is located right on campus, and gives you quick access to a very exquisite and dynamic urban culture. Besides being so well situated, her apartment is quiet and conducive to serious intellectual work and/or rest. Faylene and her roommate are also very considerate and will respect your privacy. I am quite certain you will like them, their apartment and the location of the apartment.",,
12,6,Very affordable and great location,,
12,9,The window is too small. An affordable place. Worth it.,,
12,11,"Love the location! It is in campus and easy to walk around anywhere you want. Especially in the winter which made it ever better. The thing I think need big improvement is cleanliness and the odor of the apt. I cleaned my room and found out a lot places are covered by dust, same as blanket. I also need to open the window all day to reduce the odor.",,
12,15,Great place for budget travellers!,,
12,13,Very comfortable and cozy place. Location is good! The host responses msg quickly. Lots of privacy if you need. Enough storage places. Would recommend it.,,
12,1,"The room is too small. But the price is so low, so I can not complain.",,
12,2,"Great place, even better location. Some minor cleanliness issues, but nothing that would prevent us from staying here again. You really don't see much of the hosts, but Faylene was excellent at communicating with us through the app. Would recommend!",,
12,7,"Quaint room, very clean. Faylene and her partner were very friendly and helpful!",,
12,8,I have to share the kitchen with others. I am uncomfortable to share it with my roommates. They are always making the kitchen dirty. I hate it.,,
12,1,Perfect location for me at an amazing price! Love all the restaurants right downstairs!,,
12,2,"The window is too small, no sunshine in the morning. I may choose another place next time.",,
12,4,"Great communication, amazing location if you are visiting campus (2 minutes walk to school of music). Lots of places to eat literally next door. Nice place, my room was clean and the bathroom, the living room and the kitchen were messy, but everything else was good.",,
12,5,"In a great location. The apartment building is new and has places to eat on the first floor. Very well located. Walking distance from most places in UIUC. Also, a great shower! Near instant hot water! Host leaves you to your own devices but is quick to reply to messages. Overall I had a great stay! Would definitely recommend.",,
13,3,"The place was good. There was construction going on resulting in a lot of noise during the day. Positive - Comfort, space, amenities, cleanliness, felt like home away from home. Negative - The building cleaner (not sure who he was exactly) barged into the house one day without ringing the bell to spray something in the house. It was a rude invasion of privacy. However, we did not have the door locked but it took me by surprise (not the pleasant one). There was some smell as soon as we entered the house, I guess it was in the corridor.
",,
13,7,"Very good place with high quality furniture! The cookware, the washer&dryer are extremely new, and the two bedrooms are very comfortable. I will definitely recommend this place for a short-term stay",,
13,1,"The room is big, but it it a bit expensive for me. ",,
13,4,"The apartment was clean, spacious, and well-located on Green street, walking distance to campus and downtown Champaign. As others have said, the beds are very stiff and seemed a little short. In mid July, MCORE construction on green street was right outside the window, but it wasn't too loud before 9am. The apartment is operated by a property management company.",,
13,2,The location is near the downtown. It is a bit noisy in the evening.,,
13,8,"This airbnb was the first I have ever stayed in and overall was great. The apartment was very clean, and had all of the basic necessities. Check in was very easy, simply stop by the office and pick up everything, it took no more than five minutes. In addition the location was amazing, close to everything. The only down side was the beds, they were extremely uncomfortable and hard but overall the apartment was great, I recommend staying here.",,
13,5,"Very clean, comfort and spacious unit. Perfect location right in the heart of uiuc's campus.",,
13,7,The apartment was very clean. The pictures on the listing are very accurate. The apartment accommodated perfectly our family. Just wished the beds were more comfortable.,,
13,11,"Too expensive for me. If not all other rooms were registered by others, I will choose another place.",,
13,15,"Good place, good location. The price is a little high for me. Not worth it.",,
14,5,The room is fairly good. But the price is too high. It does not worth it at all. So ridiculous.,,
14,15,The host is not friendly. His room was in a mess. I hate this experience.,,
14,11,"So bad, so stupid place.",,
14,2,Too expensive. How could the host charged me so much money.,,
14,3,I will never be back any more.,,
14,7,"I have booked at Elijah's place a few weeks in advance. In the last week before my arrival, I contacted via Airbnb and at last thru a phone call. But there was no reply and phone call wasn't picked up. So I just assumed I could checked in. After 20+ hour flight, we arrived in Chicago and when I called him, he said that the place cannot be used and he has been sending messages via Airbnb, but when I checked my Airbnb, the status still confirmed and no reply from him. So I left stranded at airport without place to stay. Luckily I found a hotel room. About 1 hour away from my destination from expedia",,
14,8,"Stupid host, stupid room, stupid travel. I was so fool to choose this place.",,
14,9,Clean access to campus.,,
14,1,The host is kind but I must say this is the worset stay I have ever experience.,,
14,7,"Good location. Easy to get to the University, shopping centers, hospital,etc.",,
14,8,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. So bad experience.,,
15,5,Very clean and neat. Highly recommend.,,
15,4,It was such a cute and cozy space. The hosts were amazing and instructions were easy to follow.,,
15,2,"This place is solid for anyone looking to stay near downtown Champaign, or close to the university without being on campus. I was able to walk to green street in about 30min, which may not be preferable to some but was quite lovely and certainly doable. Would definitely recommend for any visiting lecturers, professionals, etc who may want some quiet away from the hustle and bustle.
",,
15,14,"All is well thought out - everything one needs is there. It is clean and cozy. Very close to the campus and downtown. I cannot imagine a better place to spend a few days and nights! Kudos to the owner for a job well done!
",,
15,13,"Ron is an amazing host and his place is lovely. It is conveniently located in a nice and quiet neighborhood with easy access to the UI campus. The amenities are great and I felt so relaxed and at home during my week there. The apartment was spotless and had everything I needed. Ron was so nice that he dropped me off at the terminal to catch my bus out to Chicago when I was leaving. If I ever have to come back to Champaign, I am looking no further than his place. In fact, I'll be very unhappy if I don't get to stay at his place on my next trip. I hope all hosts could be like him. This has been my best Airbnb experience so far :)",,
15,11,"Great space. Ron provided everything we needed, even a choice of pillows. Super clean and well-appointed.
",,
15,4,"Very comfortable. Slept great. Quiet. 2 thick pillows, 2 thin pillows (and that's just in the bedroom.) The sofa is also a recliner! Great communication. It's a lot of stairs to the 3rd floor. But a private staircase on side of house. So, it's your own private suite-in-the-sky. I'll be back -- the greatest recommendation I can give.",,
15,7,"The place was very clean, a little smaller than the pictures show but it wasn¡¯t problem. The fireplace is a nice touch and it was very close to the university which is super convenient.",,
15,9,Ron's place was great. 2nd Floor of a house with its own private entrance and self check in. Full kitchen and bathroom. Clean and spacious. About a 5-10min ride from U of I campus. Ron was also and amazing host. Would defenitely stay here again next time I'm in the area.,,
15,10,"This is a cozy spot in a great location--easy on and off the highway especially--that was very quiet and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay--and appreciated the sparkling juice for our anniversary. Would definitely stay there again!
",,
16,12,"It's an excellent place to stay! B&B that's in a quiet residential neighborhood but not far from the restaurants and shops to downtown Champaign and a close drive to campus. The property is beautiful, the room is clean and comfortable, the breakfast was help yourself with a great selection of food and drinks, the owners/innkeepers (and their two small dogs) were very hospitable, and the price was very reasonable. It's really a hidden gem if you want to try something different than your stereotypical, cookie-cutter hotel.",,
16,15,I love the home look of the whole place. It was very relaxing and quiet.,,
16,1,"The location, the upkeep of the property, two adorable pups and the vintage vibe of the whole place is amazing. Also, bottled water and tea and snacks are available always which is amazing",,
16,2,"Our family took three rooms on the second floor for a one night stay in January of 2019. Cold outside but warm inside.  Wonderful old 1897 home in excellent condition.  Well run and welcoming. We will return, probably i the summer!",,
16,5,"I was happy to be invited to their Halloween party. They sure threw a classy, fun party. I have not been an overnight guest in the B&B but from what I could see it was a fantastic place.",,
16,4,Nice clean but stairs to third floor to high all supply is on the first floor.,,
16,3," I ended up being there only to sleep.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom for my room was across the hall, which wasn't really a problem other than I worried about disturbing other guests as I arrived late and left very early.",,
16,3,The property was very nice and cozy. It reminded me of home.,,
16,7,"Good room, but it was too experience.",,
16,9,I like the free breakfast there. The location is also ok.,,
16,11,Lovely Victorian house. Our room was large and comfortable. Kevin is a gracious host. Walking distance to downtown Champaign. My husband and I recommend it highly.,,
17,1,"Modern and well located hotel in the center of downtown Champaign IL. The rooms are clean spacious and well-maintained. I stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed the comfortable bed, large bathroom, breakfast and attractive lobby. Parking was not free but the parking garage was safe, clean and available exclusively for guests with room cards. There are lots of very good to excellent restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the hotel.",,
17,2,Excellent.  Staff very very friendly.   Came on late due to roads and was very please when went to room.  Very clean bed comfortable and wish i had the shower in my home. Great breakfast. Large buffet. Plenty parking.,,
17,3,Very easy to work with and lovely event spaces! Their staff is so accommodating and we appreciate how they help make our jobs easier. We always look forward to collaborating with them in order to make a bride or client¡¯s day memorable!,,
17,4,This hotel is very nice and very clean. All of the staff was very friendly. It has an on site parking garage that is $9.00 a day. They serve food and drinks here. Including alcoholic drinks. The hotel is located in a great area with many,,
17,5,"Rooms are clean and stylish and the staff is pleasant. I reserved a queen size bed. But when I entered my room, I fount my bed was too small. I can not share my bed with my husband which made me very uncomfortable.",,
17,6,"I Will definitely come back and definitely refer to a friends, very nice helpful staff and the room is super clean, we¡¯re  very satisfied.",,
17,7,My room was excellent.  Great sleeping there with a good supportive bed.  I ordered a snack from the bar and it was warm and delicious.  Breakfast was bountiful with many choices.  Parking was easily managed with the ramp connected to the hotel.,,
17,8,"The rooms are updated and very clean. The staff was quite friendly and helpful. The hotels location gave us plenty of options for food, shopping and drinks within walking distance.",,
17,9,"Clean rooms and a good shower. The king rooms have a full size couch, which was nice. View of downtown champaign from some rooms is nice too. Only 1 elevator was working though, which wasn't ideal. The fitness facility is nice",,
17,10,Check in was speedy. The location is great. The room was clean and up to date.,,
17,1,"Mediocre hotel. Has great potential, but continues to miss the mark. We¡¯re 0-2 with this location. For such a new hotel, it¡¯s been used and abused. While the convenience to the nightlife is there, everything else is just head aches. ",,
18,2,The room was not neat. Need to be improved.,,
18,4,My room was 77 degrees the entire time of my stay.  This made it difficult to conduct work from the room as I was sweating the whole time. I turned the temperature down but this played no effect. I opened the windows but they were limited. I must say it was a bad experience.,,
18,6,The bathroom needed updating.  Shower showed it's age.,,
18,8,It was a nice place to stay Legands Bar just a few steps away . But the unloading and loading  needs inporvmen,,
18,10,Both times we have gone with a college visit with our daughter to the University Illinois Champagne Urbana this was the hotel we stayed at.  Definitely will be the one we stay at if we are in town again.  Great staff and service.  Great location in relation to the college campus.,,
18,7,Nice and new but not the cleanest.,,
18,9,Front desk woman was rude and the most unhelpful. Wouldn't let my guests use a restroom as we were checking in. As she was checking us in I didn't have my families paperwork that they work for the Marriot so she asks me if I want to pay full price instead of using their discount. I had to wait for them since we drove seperate. At the computer she watched us struggle for almost an hour and offered zero help. I'm also getting random charges more than what the room was. We were over an hour and a half late to our event. Had to use the restroom. She took the keycards back out of my hand and made us wait longer. She was very rude to me and my guests. I had no other problems with any staff at the hotel other than 'Karee'. Only stayed here because of convenience of location next to our event which we barely made it too and it was a 2 minute drive.,,
18,1,Sadly there's no available parking for a Pickup Truck with a Topper. Unfortunate; we've heard good reviews from family members.,,
19,1,"In town for conference. Good standard quality room: comfortable bed, well designed bathroom, quiet. The cleanliness was impressive and the housekeeping should be commended for a job very well done. The lobby lounge is comfortable and inviting and made for a nice space to visit with colleagues. The breakfast offerings were nothing out of the ordinary but good. My stay was overall a pleasant and welcoming experience.",,
19,2,"I would give -1 if I could.  The morning of checkout:  no power, no hot water, no breakfast, no communication from the front desk, no compensation, nothing at all on 3/10/19.  I received a response from the hotel (after I filled out their survey) giving an apology, but here is the clincher.  She used the excuse that the entire city was without power - wrong!  Perkins restaurant, right next door, as well all of the other businesses on University Avenue up to I-74 had power.  Another Hilton rep then sent me a response backing the manager up.  I expect honesty and customer service from a Hilton hotel and this one doesn't measure up, especially for $150 plus tax/night.  By the way, thank you to Urbana Garden Family Restaurant for a wonderful breakfast and friendly service.",,
19,3,Excellent visit to this hotel! Very friendly and helpful staff. They set up the room for our honeymoon and did an excellent job! We will definitely be visiting this hotel again in the near future! My visit to this hotel was the BEST visit to a hotel I've ever had! Great job! Keep up the great work!!!,,
19,4,"Nice well located hotel. Rooms are spacious,  clean and comfortable. Staff is generally friendly and helpful, especially the breakfast room staff.",,
19,5,We recently had a small family get together here. We had 1 suite (handicapped accessible) and a standard room. Both were clean and nicely decorated. Staff was friendly and helpful.,,
19,6,"I have enjoyed staying at this hotel brand only, this location was the worst. Although we were given a suite and late checkout, I felt that I have had better experience at other states I have visited and stayed only hilton hotels or brands.",,
19,7,"Pretty standard for a Hampton.. but not a business hotel, more a college campus variant.. because that's more or less where it is.  Clean, neat rooms, attentive staff.. just a little higher traffic and larger than most.",,
19,8,"Very accommodating staff. We had a lovely stay. Would have been nice to have USB charging in room. Breakfast was typical for a Hampton; nothing special. Workout room has exactly three machines: one each of stationary bike, elliptical, and treadmill. Luckily it wasn¡¯t crowded!",,
19,9,It was very conveniently located near the U of I campus.,,
19,10,Rose at the front desk went out of her way to help up with the s rew u from Expedia. The property is nice. The rooms ab bathrooms were just fine. We have high hopes for our breakfast,,
19,11,You couldnt find a more helpful staff.  Our room was wonderful and the location made my trips to campus a breeze.  I couldnt of been more pleased.,,
20,15,"Excellent place to stay.  Big rooms with all the comforts of home.  A full size fridge, microwave, sink with garbage disposal and full size dishwasher for the real dishes and utinsels in the room.  Clean comfy bed.  Only drawback is NO BAR.  Other than that great friendly staff pointed me across the lot to a great little pub.",,
20,14,"what a nice hotel. front desk folks were so helpful, clean entry, clean spacious room.  breakfast bar great selections and tasty!  would totally stay again.",,
20,13,I love Home2 Suites' concept of comfortable convertible living spaces that are efficient and stylish. Excellent staff. Tasty free breakfast. Overall service level is consistent from location to location as well.,,
20,12,"Clean and super comfortable. A great place to stay with little kids (we have 2 years and 6 months). Great breakfast area and food...loved the healthy options and good coffee! Only complaint is we were told there would be a bath tub, and they do not have any rooms with tubs. Shower actually worked out really well with the kids though. We will definitely be staying here again!",,
20,11,I loved the dining and shopping nearby and being so close to U of I campus!,,
20,10,"For anyone staying here who has the intention of visiting campus, this place is perfect. It's in a super convenient location near a lot of restaurants. There are two outdoor patio areas, one situated more for adults and another where one could bring a family. There is also an indoor pool, but when I was a guest, the water was far too cold. The rooms are decently sized, and allow you to have a comfortable stay. Breakfast the following morning is just your typical hotel style breakfast.",,
20,9,Dont stay here. Bathroom is barn style. The doors dont have locks and they dont close fully. Front desk told me all rooms are like this. There is a private bathroom but common to all guests. Absolutely not family friendly. I would suggest stay away from here. We made a mistake. But we will not stay here any longer,,
20,8,Loved the space and amenities..a little noisy at night.,,
20,7,"Quick check in. Clean room and comfortable beds. Issues with fire alarm, with no explanation offered. Made to wait in the frigid weather outside and the front desk folks deflected any questions. Unprofessional.",,
20,6,"Quick trip - arrived at hotel very late due to airplane delay, everyone was very friendly at check-in. was hoping to use pool and hot tub but didn't have time. Lobby was clean, Room was clean. Breakfast fruits were good. Oatmeal runny. Eggs horrible. was expecting something fresh.",,
