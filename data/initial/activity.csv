1,Twiddle + Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at The Canopy Club 4/25,Gary,The Canopy Club,Urbana,music,"In the live setting, more and more people are invigorated by Twiddle¡¯s community, promoting positivity and the band¡¯s skillful improvisational music. So many like-minded people believe in the greater good, and they find that good in Twiddle.¡°We pour every ounce of ourselves into every note when we perform live,¡± says Pigeons Playing Ping Pong singer/guitarist Greg Ormont. ¡°When we¡¯re recording in the studio, we try to maintain that euphoria while finding a way to pack it into a tight, focused vessel. Each song becomes like a spring-loaded can of worms: there¡¯s all this energy boxed up in a neat little package, and then when you come see us live, the cap comes off and the contents fly out in every direction like fireworks.¡±
